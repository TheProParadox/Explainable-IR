#### Work Done

Given a query, we have retrieved top 30 ranked documents out of a pre-defined index (MS-MARCO). Out of this, A simple classifer has been designed for classifying top 10 and 10-30 ranking based on feature vectors based to TF of words. And counterfactuals have been generated using DICE-ML. 

#### Task
Make a argument and class based python files for all steps and test counterfactual based on new index.
