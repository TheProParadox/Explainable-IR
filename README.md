#### Work Done

Given a query, we have retrieved top 30 ranked documents out of a pre-defined index (MS-MARCO). Out of this, A simple classifer has been designed for classifying top 10 and 10-30 ranking based on feature vectors based to TF of words. And counterfactuals have been generated using DICE-ML. I took 5 random queries from test-dev subset of MSMARCO and got top100 for each and convert into collection to index. Then added the CF and tested it.

#### Task
Work on DRMM model.....Complete CF generation and start getting results
